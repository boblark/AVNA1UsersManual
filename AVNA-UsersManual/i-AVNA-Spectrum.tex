\subsection{Discussion}
Multiple FFT are averaged together to produce the ASA graph.  The width of the display can be varied in 2:1 steps from 3 to 48 kHz with the resolution bandwidth varying proportionally.  The normal scale is 80 dB which is10 dB/div, but a 5 dB/div option is available along with offsets in 5 dB steps.  The peak level on the screen is indicated at the top left and the frequency of this peak is at the top right.  The level may be higher than the graphics peak as it is the sum power of the peak "bin" and the two adjacent ones.  The frequency indication includes interpolation between bins and has counter accuracy for stronger sine waves.  The input goes to the right hand Transmission port.  The calibration is in dBm into 50 Ohms and assumes that the 50 Ohm input terminator is switched in.
